                        R.E.M Farming Limited had engaged the profesional services of Alister Bull to assist in a varienty of ares including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disputes Resolutions</li>

                        </ul>
                        He has proved to be most effective in adding value to our business in these areas,
                        in part due to his comprehensive range of industry contacts, and his mana within the banking and financial industries.
                        We have found him to be both methodical and meticulous in his approach to our affairs,
                        uncompromising when necessary, yet conciliatory at the appropriate moment.<br>
                        He has also been very good at wielding a big stick and keeping us on track.
                        In our team he is the equivalent of former All Black Brad Thorn – very professional,
                        quiet and calm, but not intimidated by anyone. He doesn’t take a backward step
                        and works away diligently beneath the radar in dark places were others fear to go.
                        I have no hesitation in recommending Alister to others requiring assistance in these areas.
